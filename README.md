- ### Hi there, I'm Andrew Archer ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Front End Developer with a background in military service and a strong commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
During my five years of military experience, I had the privilege of leading a team on a combat deployment, where I conducted extensive training, mentoring,
and ensured the safety and alertness of my team members throughout the deployment.
These experiences reinforced my belief in the value of teamwork, communication, and adaptability.

ðŸš€ As a developer, I love diving into front-end technologies and exploring innovative solutions. I'm currently immersed in the world of
JavaScript and React and constantly seeking to expand my skill set and contribute to impactful projects.

ðŸ’¼ I'm currently pursuing a Full stack Developer apprenticeship at ERA Solutions, a company that shares my passion for empowering
Veterans in the tech industry and building meaningful websites and applications.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me at Archer.Andrew.J@outlook.com.
I'm always open to collaboration and learning from fellow developers.
