## Hi there, I'm Andrew Archer ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer at SharperMMS with a background in military leadership and a strong passion for building scalable, impactful software. After five years of leading teams in high-pressure environments, including a combat deployment, I developed a deep appreciation for teamwork, discipline, and adaptabilityâ€”qualities I bring to my development work.

ðŸš€ My expertise spans both front-end and back-end technologies, including React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and AWS. Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into REST API development with Symfony, low-level systems programming in C, and cloud infrastructure with Azureâ€”focusing on DevOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills at SharperMMS, where I work on robust full stack solutions and continually explore new tools and technologies to stay ahead in the software world.

ðŸ“« Letâ€™s connect! Feel free to reach out at Archer.Andrew.J@outlook.com. Iâ€™m always open to collaborating and learning from fellow developers.
