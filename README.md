## Hi there, I'm Andrew Archer ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer with a background in military leadership and a strong passion for building scalable, impactful software. After five years of leading teams in high-pressure environments, including a combat deployment, I developed a deep appreciation for teamwork, discipline, and adaptabilityâ€”qualities I bring to my development work.

ðŸš€ My expertise spans both front-end and back-end technologies, including React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, and AWS. Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay on the cutting edge of software development.

ðŸ’¼ Currently, Iâ€™m honing my skills as a Full Stack Developer apprentice at ERA Solutions, where Iâ€™m working on building dynamic applications and contributing to projects that empower veterans in the tech industry.

ðŸ“« Letâ€™s connect! Feel free to reach out at Archer.Andrew.J@outlook.com. Iâ€™m always open to collaborating and learning from fellow developers.
